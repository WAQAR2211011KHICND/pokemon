# React Poke Card

_Grabbing onto React hooks._

## High Level Goals of this Sprint
* Become familiar with functional react.
* Apply hooks to control and manipulate your app.
* Leverage an API to populate your app with data based on the url string.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

Complete all the bare minimum requirements before moving on to the advanced content. This sprint gives you a substantial amount of creative freedom. We recommend that you read through all the requirements and hold a short planning session with your pair to discuss what your final product will be.

- [] Renders a Pokemon Card based on the query parameters in the address bar. Do not use react-router for this assignment. [See here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56111914/how-to-read-url-parameters-within-component-in-react-js) for one way that you could accomplish this.

- [] Makes requests to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to populate a Card of the Pokemon queried.

- [] You can use fetch to make your api call or you may choose to incorporate a different library like [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

- [] Use `useEffect` and `useState` properly to establish appropriate state management.

- [] The pokemon card should contain the pokemon's name, sprite, and any other at a glance information that may be beneficial. Play with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) interface to see what type of information is available for a pokemon.

- [] When the card is clicked, render the 'back' of the card with a full glimpse of information about that pokemon.

- [] Add your own style and flair to the page. Be creative.



A base repository built with Create-React-App has been provided for you.

## Advanced Content

Our advanced content is intended to throw you in over your head, requiring you to solve problems with very little support or oversight, much like you would as a mid or senior level engineer.

Feel free to experiment with other React features while tackling these. You may choose to do any or all of these in any order:

- [] Implement a side bar that shows all possible evolutions of the current pokemon(ie. 'charmander', 'charmeleon', 'charizard'). 
  - [] Each evolution should show a name and sprite as well as 
  - [] Make a clickHandler redirecting the user to the associated page for that pokemon.

- [] Add a navigation bar that allows the user to find other Pokemon.
  - [] Either implement a search feature that renders results on the current page.
  - [] Or display mini cards of randomly selected other pokemon.
